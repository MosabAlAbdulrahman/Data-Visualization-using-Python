# PRODIGY_DS_01
Implementation of the first task of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship

# Task Details:
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## This is the implementaion of the first task of my Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship
### I used Titanic dataset - the file named "Train.csv"- and implemented the following :
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading the Dataset
- Exploring the Data
- Dropping unuseful columns
- Checking for Duplicates
- Checking for Missing Values
- Plotting a histogram to show the distribution of the "Age" Variable
